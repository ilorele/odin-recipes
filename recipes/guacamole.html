        <h2 class="headline mid">What is guacamole</h2>
        <p>Guacamole is an avocado-based dip or spread that originated in Mexico. It's typically made with mashed avocado and lime juice, then seasoned with salt and cilantro. Guacamole often contains tomatoes and onions.</p>
        <p>Avocados have a tendency to turn brown when they're exposed to air, so guacamole loses its brightness rather quickly. You can prevent this by placing the guacamole in an airtight container, then covering the top with a thin layer of water, lemon juice, or lime juice. This barrier will keep the air from getting in. Seal the container and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days.</p>
